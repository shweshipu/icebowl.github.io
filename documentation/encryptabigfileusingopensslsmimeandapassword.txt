Create a new key and a certificate request (you will be prompted for additional information to complete the request):

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privkey.pem -out req.pem

Self-sign the certificate request to create a certificate

openssl x509 -req -in req.pem -signkey privkey.pem -out cert.pem
(You can delete req.pem at this point if you wish)

Encrypt the file using the newly generated certificate:

openssl smime -encrypt -aes256 -in ABC.xml -binary -outform DER -out DEF.xml cert.pem
The file can then be decrypted using:

openssl smime -decrypt -in DEF.xml -inform DER -inkey privkey.pem -out GHI.xml
